# Final Project (Cannon War)

This project aims to develop a basic version of cannon war game. On the gaming console,
robots and cannons will fight against each other. Gamer may visualize the destruction with an
associated sound. Robot and cannons will be drawn with different colors. The gamer will
control the robot (through mouse and keyboard) for self-defense (fire-back/ escape). Cannons
will be moving at pace set by the programmer (that changes overtime). Game progress that
includes gamer score, life remaining etc. will be displayed on the console. Game will
terminate in either of the two scenarios:

```
i. Robot destroyed all cannons
ii. Cannon destroyed the robot
```
Furthermore, a gamer may be able to pause the game. Statistics will be displayed on both
termination and pause. These include: total time played, score etc. This project is divided into
different phases, the details of each are given below.

## Phase1 

Phase1 deals with the following:
```
1. Draw the game console with at least two cannons (at top) and a robot (on bottom).
    You may use colors and special character (ASCII).
2. Move them randomly (left or right) at a changing pace
3. Cannon(s) will be able to fire at the robot, while robot will try to avoid these.
4. A statistic bar should be part of the gaming console.
5. Load Instructions from file and display it initially.
```
.

## Phase 2

Phase2 deals with the following:
```
1. Control robot movement through keyboard.
2. Damage detection.
3. Modify health
4. Calculate Total Scores.
```
## Phase 3:

Phase 3 deals with the following:
```
1. Control robot movement through mouse
2. Firing through mouse
```
## Phase 4:

Phase 4 deals with the following:
```
1. Resume capability.
2. Sound addition.
3. Maintaining a detailed log (store all scores and also store high score in spate file).
```

## Summary:

## Instructions
```
- The project consists of 4 phases. Each phase will have a deadline. If you miss a
    deadline of a particular phase you will not be awarded any credit in that phase.
- Each next phase will be dependent on the previous phase, so you must start working
    on the project from day-1.
- You are required to work in MASM
- A group of maximum size three is allowed.
- User Interface is important in this project. Try to develop an attractive user interface.
- Use of extra features in the project is encouraged.
- Use good programming practices (well commented and indented code; meaningful
    variable names, readable code etc.).
- _Copy/cheating case will be awarded an “F” grade in the_ course.
```
## Good luck
